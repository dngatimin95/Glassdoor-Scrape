# Glassdoor-Scrape

*This repo is targeted only for those seeking a career in data science, software engineer or data/business analyst. Hopefully, it can be expanded further for other careers.*
This repo takes in a career of the user's choice, along with a location and the number of jobs one wants to know about. It then scrapes the Glassdoor website for the number of jobs, and stores important information into a dataframe which can then be exported into a csv or excel file. It collects information such as the job title, salary estimate, job description, rating, company name and exact location. After scraping and storing into a database, it looks into the job description and tallies certain keywords by tokenizing the job description. It basically counts how much each important keywords are mentioned such as how much the word "Bachelor's" appears compared to "Masters" or how often programming langauages such as "Python" or "SQL" appears in job descriptions. Afterwards, it is all stored into a different dataframe and plotted out to show users what the most important skills are.
